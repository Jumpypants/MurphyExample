# Example FTC Project Using the Murphy Library

This an example project for the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics competition that demonstrates how to use the Murphy Library.
[Murphy GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Jumpypants/Murphy)

I recommend looking through this project to get a feel for how to use the library before using it in your own project.

This is a simple theoretical robot meant to be used in the Into the Deep game.
